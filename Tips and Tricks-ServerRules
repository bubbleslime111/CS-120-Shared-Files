In order to best use github here are a few tricks:
1) To create a folder, hit add file and then type "foldername/filename"
2) DO NOT EDIT OR STEAL PROGRAMS, they are only shared for teamwork/testing/entertainment.
3) Don't submit programs unless you are OK with other users testing them.
4) Please include your name in your programs, so people know who to contact.
5) If you create a function which you think will be very useful in the future, please post it to Public/functions.
6) Use ctrl+s to save a file directly to your computer.
Most importantly: Have fun coding.
